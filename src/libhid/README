Special Notes on compiling the libhid version.

1. You must have installed the following packages
      libusb
      libusb-devel
      libusb-static

   For example, on Fedora Core 8, they would be
      libusb-static-0.1.12-10.fc8
      libusb-0.1.12-10.fc8
      libusb-devel-0.1.12-10.fc8

   An easy way to get this is:
     yum install libusb libusb-devel libusb-static

2. You need to make and install the latest version of libhid
   Instructions on doing this is at http://libhid.alioth.debian.org/.

   Under Debian:  apt-get install libhid-dev python-hid
  
   Under RedHat: svn co svn://svn.debian.org/libhid/trunk libhid-svn
   cd libhid-svn
   sh ./autogen.sh
   make
   make install
   (There may be some tweaking under FC6.  You might want to disable SWIG).

3. Get the file 60-mcc.rules from ftp://lx10.tx.ncsu.edu/pub/Linux/drivers
   cp 60-mcc.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
   /sbin/udevcontrol --reload_rules 
             or
   /sbin/udevadm control --reload-rules
     

4. NOW you are ready to compile the MCC libhid programs
   tar zxvf  MCCLIBHID.1.32.tgz
   cd libhid
   make
   make install
